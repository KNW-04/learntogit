First, if you're using git for the first time on your computer, you need to conduct these process below:
    1. open terminal and type these commands:
        git config --global user.name "your github name here"
        git config --global user.email "your github email here"
    
Setting up your project local repository:
    1. Go to the folder that you'll use as a local repository
    2. type cd (folder path) on your terminal
    3. type this command:
        git init

    
Uploading a file to github
    - to connect your folder and the online repository, you need to type this command with your terminal ready.
        git remote add origin (your github repository link)

        your terminal should be directed to the folder where you're working with git
        (for example, if your folder name is Git Practice, your terminal should start with:
        (base) namgyuwoo@Namgyus-MacBook-Pro Git Practice % )
    
    - git add .
    this command adds your file to a temporary repository on your computer, which called "Index."
    make sure you have a blank space between add and .
    . means you would like to upload all files in your local repository.

    - git commit -m "Comment"
    This is used when you commit your file.
    You should review your file several times before you use it.
